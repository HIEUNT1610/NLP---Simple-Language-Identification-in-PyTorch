The report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia hails the achievements in the implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement , which deals with the political aspect of inter-ethnic relations .
The report comments on economic performance , the adoption of several crucial laws on prosecutors , and progress in the fight against corruption .
On the negative side , we regret the signing of the Bilateral Immunity Agreement by the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with the United States , which grants exemption from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court in contradiction of EU standards and policies .
The report calls on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Greece to increase efforts to overcome the dispute on the name of the country .
That should in no circumstances become an obstacle to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 's membership of international organisations .
On the name issue , the report does not criticise either of the two sides .
It only encourages both sides to carry on negotiations , despite what happened at the NATO Summit in Bucharest last week .
Fortunately Javier Solana said yesterday in the European Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee that negotiations on the name will continue .
If the two sides agree , NATO can take a decision to invite the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia immediately , even at ambassador level , so a new summit will be needed .
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia could get a date for the start of accession negotiations this year .
The European Parliament should give a clear lead for the country towards European integration .
( DA ) Mr President , when we talk about the Balkans , we have to look at the region as a unified whole .
The EU 's long-term objective is the accession of all Balkan countries .
For this objective to be achieved , results are also expected on the part of the countries themselves .
A common European future is the joint task of the Member States and all the Balkan countries .
We Nordic countries are no stranger to historical conflicts , but are now working together .
The Balkans , like the Nordic region , are bound together by a common history , common languages and a common culture throughout their length and breadth .
It should be possible , therefore , to launch a process of cooperation to ensure peace and stability .
At present , there are a number of cooperation agreements between countries in the region .
Why not go one step further ?
Taking inspiration from Nordic cooperation , the Balkan countries could establish a cooperation forum along the lines of the Nordic Council or the Baltic Council .
Intensifying the existing regional political cooperation in the form of a Balkan Council will enable these countries to enter into practical , forward-looking cooperation , which will offer an opportunity to stabilise the region and make those countries that are not yet Member States or official candidate countries more prepared for accession .
( PL ) Mr President , Croatia , that old European nation with a long history and an interesting culture , should be brought into the European family of nations known as the European Union as soon as possible .
Croatia , a country applying to join the Union , paradoxically has a longer history than some of the founding states of the European Community , such as Belgium and Luxembourg .
Zagreb and Split are very European places , while Dubrovnik is a jewel in Europe 's cultural crown .
During this debate , most of the speakers , including myself , have spoken wearing ties .
It is worth remembering that ties were invented by the Croats and it should also be emphasised here in the European Parliament , which so values liberty and freedom , that the Croatian port of Dubrovnik was the first in Europe to prohibit trading in slaves at the beginning of the 15th century .
Given this situation , we do not even have a moral right to hold back Croatia 's access to the Union .
( FR ) The fact that I am acting as President but not wearing a tie quite clearly has nothing to do with the item on the agenda .
( EL ) Mr President , the Meijer report and the unanimous resolutions of the EU-Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Joint Parliamentary Committee both emphasise the three vital steps FYROM has taken towards Europe .
The first step , of course involves meeting accession requirements and complying with the acquis communautaire .
Although FYROM has made progress , it must continue its journey of reform as stressed both in the Meijer report and in various other reports by the European Commission .
The second step concerns internal policies and social cohesion .
It must continue to abide by the Ohrid Agreement , especially as far as the Albanians and also other minorities in this multi-ethnic country are concerned .
The third step is resolving the differences between FYROM and its neighbours in accordance with the Salzburg Declaration .
Let me stress here that Greece was - and continues to be - at the forefront of endeavours to achieve the accession of all the Balkan states to Euro-Atlantic structures , since it firmly believes that the development of the countries in the region will benefit all .
For Greece , however , the name issue is not simply a historical , psychological or emotional problem .
It is a genuine political issue for all Greek citizens , as it concerns the European values of good neighbourliness and regional cooperation .
May I remind you that Greece agreed to FYROM being awarded the status of accession candidate subject , of course , to the proviso in COM ( 2007 ) 663 that a mutually acceptable solution to the name issue be found through negotiations .
Finally , I should point out that even after the postponement in Bucharest of an invitation to FYROM to join NATO pending the resolution of the name issue , Greece is in favour of continued negotiations .
In fact , it has taken the generous compromise step of suggesting an acceptable composite name , so all that remains for the other side to do is to meet Greece halfway .
In conclusion , Mr President , I should like to believe that compromises will be reached regarding the few points still to be clarified , enabling us to go ahead with the vote in Strasbourg .
Madam President , Croatia has a European vocation : the recent invitation to join NATO and the current negotiations to join the EU are a testimony to that .
This is quite an achievement for a country which only a decade ago was practically at war .
Equally , however , that is not enough to eliminate the challenges still facing both Croatia and the EU on the way to completing those negotiations .
The timetable is extremely tight ; practically each day counts , irrespective of the different dates advanced for the finalisation of the process .
However , when I visited Zagreb some time ago at the head of the delegation from the Committee on Foreign Affairs , I took note of the determination of the Croatian authorities to do away with those problems and achieve membership of the Union .
In this respect , the recent decision of the Croatian Parliament to exempt the EU states from the application of the Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone ( ZERP ) following Commissioner Rehn 's visit , is both a testimony to that determination and is an important step in the right direction .
I am convinced that , with the right administrative capacity to implement the required legislation , Croatia , in both the EU and NATO , will be a solid factor of stability and progress in an area that still needs our full attention .
I congratulate Mr Swoboda on all his work reflected in this report .
( SV ) Thank you , Madam President .
Croatia plays a key role in the democratic development of the Western Balkans , and it is immensely important that the process should continue .
We saw that , for understandable reasons , it slowed down somewhat during the Croatian election campaign and the formation of a new government , but now I really hope that the process will put on some speed .
As previous speakers have noted , the timetable is extremely tight .
I welcome the temporary lifting of the restrictions in the Ecological Zone in the Adriatic .
It is a positive signal for relations between Slovenia , Italy and Croatia , but environmental considerations must continue to weigh heavily in our treatment of this unique marine environment .
Croatia still has a great deal to do as regards the reform of the legal system and the judicial process .
Far too many people still have to wait far too long for a verdict on their cases .
This must be prioritised , and the country 's administrative capacity must be developed and expanded .
Finally , I welcome the work done by the EU Committee of the Croatian Parliament , which is headed by my good friend Vesna PusiÄ‡ .
We now hope that the negotiations will be excellent and that they can be concluded rapidly .
( DE ) Madam President , Mr Swoboda 's report is encouraging , realistic and balanced .
I congratulate him on it .
It shows the progress Croatia has made , such as its exemplary legislation on minorities , its constructive cooperation with the Hague Tribunal , its increased commitment to fighting corruption , and above all the agreement of Parliament and government regarding the fishing zone , which has been particularly difficult to achieve .
Croatia and the European Commission now have to bring all their resources to bear to negotiate the forthcoming chapters quickly and satisfactorily .
An international arbitrator should have the opportunity at long last to resolve the border issues between Slovenia and Croatia .
Croatia has a key role to play in the region and should be admitted to the European Union soon .
Bilateral issues must not be an obstacle .
With regard to Macedonia , I can tell you that I was at a conference there at the weekend and the mood is really very agitated following the rejection by NATO .
People feel they have been unfairly treated .
Mr Meijer 's report shows the stony path the country has already successfully trodden .
There is certainly a great deal still to do , but when the naming issue continually hangs over everything like the Sword of Damocles it is difficult to move on in other areas of policy .
I have been monitoring the situation there since 1992 and would like Macedonia and Greece to find a solution at long last to the dispute regarding the name , particularly for the young generation .
Both sides have made concessions in recent weeks and both must take another step closer to each other .
I would find it incompatible with our European values and actually irresponsible if a veto were once again to provide the opportunity to bar the country from joining the European Union .
This must not happen !
Madam President , I am very disappointed at the current relations between the West and Macedonia .
Frankly speaking , the people of Macedonia deserve far better treatment from us .
With the independence of Kosovo and the recent failure of NATO accession , the situation is even more complicated .
In Macedonia there are separatist elements on one side and nationalists on the other who try to challenge the stability of the country , and the Bucharest decision does not help the situation at all .
But perhaps our Macedonian friends can learn at least one lesson from Bucharest .
It is not enough to get the support of the US .
Many decisions depend on the common accord of the Member States , not only in the European Union but also in NATO , and any Member State may use its veto .
In the light of the latest events Macedonia should reconsider its standpoint on exempting the US from the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court .
Many mistakes were committed on both sides - by us and the Macedonian politicians - but we cannot punish ordinary people for our mistakes .
That is why at least in the field of visa liberalisation we should act quickly , assisting the Macedonian people to travel , learn and have closer contacts with everyday European life .
Three and a half years ago when I was elected Vice-Chairman of the EU-Macedonia Joint Parliamentary Committee , I had many optimistic plans on how to improve our relationships .
Very few of these ideas were realised .
I hope at least in the field of visa liberalisation we can make a step forward .
( EL ) Madam President , Greece has consistently supported the European prospects of FYROM , to whose economic development has it contributed .
We have worked systematically to find a mutually acceptable solution to the name problem under the auspices of the UN .
Greece has made significant steps and now supports a composite name with a universally binding erga omnes geographical indication .
Unfortunately , the other side has not been so willing .
Following the outcome of the NATO summit in Bucharest , it is in the interests of all sides that talks should continue and agreement be reached as swiftly as possible .
NATO 's decision not to issue an invitation does not mean the rejection of membership but points to the need for a resolution .
I believe that the original text of my fellow Member Mr Meijer 's report was balanced on this issue .
Unfortunately , owing to the amendments adopted , the report on the name issue has been overthrown .
We call upon the Members of the European Parliament not to accept formulations that interfere with the continuing negotiation process , which is entering its most crucial phase .
( SK ) Without the accession of the countries of south-eastern Europe to the EU we cannot talk about the success of European integration .
During the Cold War , the former Yugoslavia was the bastion of freedom and many emigrants , including those who had lived in the former totalitarian Czechoslovakia , fled to the West precisely through the country that was a warning to the former Soviet Union and its satellite countries .
