This new republic has not yet learnt European diplomatic practice , having placed its hopes on accession to ΝΑΤΟ simply because of US promises and infantile , misguided hopes of liberation from bondage .
In negotiations between European states provocation and fanaticism should never be an option .
Choices should not be made on the imaginary basis of ancestry , neighbouring cultures and history ; instead , we should act in a spirit of consensus , comprehension and , above all , probity in order to find a solution rather than worsen problems .
A positive approach will benefit FYROM , which we hope will be helped to join both ΝΑΤΟ and the EU .
If FYROM refuses to accept the name chosen for it and persists in this refusal , it will find that there are obstacles to its accession , because it has undermined its own efforts .
If its efforts are undermined now , perhaps its future will also be undermined .
( BG ) Surely , Mr. Meijer is aware that ' Macedonia ' and ' Macedonian nation ' are terms created by a directive of the Communist International in 1934 .
After the war , the ideas of Macedonism were taken on board and imposed with an iron fist by the Yugoslav Communist Party and later became part of the idea of Great Serbia .
These ideas include a vehement propaganda of Bulgaro-phobia .
Many people in Macedonia who are aware of their Bulgarian ethnic identity are being persecuted because of their desire to call themselves Bulgarians .
Each year in Skopje , the memorial plaque of the Bulgarian woman Mara Bouneva , a fighter for Macedonia 's freedom , whom the French press named ' Macedonia 's Charlotte Corday ' , is desecrated .
In 2007 this desecration was accompanied by a physical assault on Bulgarians and on Macedonian citizens identifying themselves as ethnic Bulgarians .
It is high time the Macedonian government put such manifestation of hatred against Bulgarians under restraint because such manifestations of hatred do not belong in the European Union .
Thank you .
( SV ) Thank you , Mr President .
The report is good throughout .
It is well balanced and gives an objective description of developments in Macedonia ; commending what has been achieved and appealing for a little more time to be devoted to what remains to be done .
But , as so often before , the debate is reduced to discussing our various views of the dispute over the country 's name rather than working out how we can get Macedonia into the EU as soon as possible .
We all know what happened at the summit in Bucharest .
I will not go into who was right or wrong or who had greater national interests to defend , but I have to say that foreign policy is not just a matter of who is right and who is wrong .
Foreign policy is about getting solutions which best serve peace and security in one 's own country or region and , in our case , Europe .
This is achieved by a mixture of goodwill , compromise , good diplomacy and clear leadership .
To prevent a country in southern Europe from becoming a member of NATO when the possibility arose is , to my mind , not a particularly wise move , given the complexity of the situation in the Balkans right now and all the challenges we face : independence in Kosovo , which is a fait accompli , the departure of the government and new elections in Serbia and still-ongoing police reforms in Bosnia .
But to block the EU membership of a Balkan country , or even just to think of doing so , is not just unwise but downright dangerous !
Only three hours ago I spoke with a colleague here in the European Parliament who said : ' If they don 't do as we want , we can block them , not just in NATO , but in the EU .
The law entitles us to do so ' .
My reaction is to say : then we must change the law !
Surely laws are not there for us to block , disrupt or blackmail one another ?
Surely they are there so that we can all get along together as best we can in a peaceful and secure Europe ?
It is my firm opinion that , the sooner all the Balkan countries are in the EU , the sooner we shall have a secure Europe .
There is absolutely no doubt that Macedonia belongs to Europe and that Macedonia should be brought into the EU as quickly as possible .
I urge you to support the report .
( SL ) In respect of the report on Croatia : both this House and the European Commission have almost enthusiastically received the news that the Croatian Parliament has suspended its decision to declare an Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone .
And it seems that owing to this decision Croatia may be rewarded with fast-track negotiations .
Although my wish is that Croatia should , in any event , join the European Union as soon as possible , I would like to warn this House , and especially the rapporteur , my friend Hannes Swoboda , that the unilateral actions of the Republic of Croatia in respect of its borders with neighbouring countries are not an exception but a rule .
What is exceptional in this matter is only that , for once , Croatia has had to withdraw its unilateral action due to being faced with a choice : either the European Union , or a nationalistic isolation .
And it is here that this pressure has proven to be useful , and I hope that Mr Swoboda and also the European Commission and the Presidency will continue to insist on the policy that unilateral actions of the Republic of Croatia regarding the determination of frontiers with neighbouring countries shall not be rewarded .
( SL ) The best way of stabilising this part of the Balkans is for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to make progress and move closer to the European Union .
Its successful negotiations will help all other neighbouring countries to make additional efforts to gain candidate status .
In order to overcome the dispute over the name , external initiatives are required .
Symbolic gestures are necessary both in Skopje and Athens , as well as perseverance .
Now is the right time to look for a less provocative name for Skopje Airport , and to condemn the disrespectful treatment of the Greek flag .
However , any further difficulties and the discrimination which holders of Macedonian passports are subjected to in connection with Greek visas are also unacceptable .
In the European Union , we are building a community of modern post-national states .
Mutual respect of differences and national identities is also an issue of respect for fundamental human rights .
Only in this way can we prevent , or at least limit any negative consequences of the feeling that one 's nationality is threatened .
We need to abolish the visa regime for all the countries in this region .
However , also required is a rapid and permanent solution for the country 's name and a comprehensive alliance between the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Greece .
Peace and stability , and fast and successful Euro-Atlantic integrations are in the interest of both the states and all the nations .
Nevertheless , Commissioner , and Mr Lenarčič , the Slovenian Presidency ought to table the Macedonian question for the next summit .
There is no need whatsoever to wait until autumn .
And one more thing about Croatia : by implementing the Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone , Croatian politics was hoisted by its own petard .
In the future such surprises will not be possible .
If this adventure has taught us something so be it , but if they have not learnt anything , then all the words and vows about finalising negotiations in 2009 is just dust in the eyes .
No one needs dust in their eyes : not the citizens , nor the economy , nor the neighbouring countries , nor the European Union .
What we now need is a success story .
However , for any success the principle of pacta sunt servanda ( agreements must be kept ) is a necessity .
( PL ) Mr President , in making a constructive assessment of Croatia 's progress , the European Union should not only set conditions , but also offer all possible assistance , bearing in mind the experience of other European states , the specifics of the region and the fresh memories of war that remain with the people of this country .
Integration of the Balkan Peninsula without Croatia is not feasible .
It should also be stressed that the last two years of cooperation have brought unexpectedly good results , and this undoubtedly bodes well for the process of integration with the European Union .
Obviously there are certain areas where more resolute action is needed .
In my view , however , the efforts made by this state should be given their due , and the whole of the EU should support such action .
Over the last two years Croatia has made laudable progress in most of the areas covered by Community law .
I would consequently express the conviction and the hope that with mutual engagement and suitable support from other Member States , negotiations will be successfully completed in time for the accession treaty to be finalised before the European Parliament elections in June 2009 .
( DE ) Mr President , a warm welcome to our counterparts from Macedonia who are following this debate .
Commissioner Rehn has said that we are encouraging Macedonia to move forward in the reform process .
' Yes , ' we all say in unison , ' we want negotiations to be opened this year . '
However , we still need to name names .
The party who has put paid to Macedonia 's ability to enter into alliance commitments is Greece , with its veto against the country 's membership of NATO .
There is admittedly a naming dispute , but we cannot ignore the fact that , in 1995 , Greece made a binding statement , valid under international law , agreeing that the naming dispute would never be an obstacle to Macedonia joining the international community , the EU or NATO .
Greece has broken this internationally binding agreement , and if we want to impose reforms in this regard , I say that Greece is in breach of European criteria and not Macedonia .
This is a step backwards , it is a slap in the face of a small state that is really making every effort to go along with us and open negotiations .
I would also say , therefore , Mr Swoboda , that the sleight of hand to stop , or postpone , tomorrow 's vote again further risks destabilising the government in Macedonia , encouraging as it does the nationalistic forces .
The actual problem is that with Greece we have an allied country that refuses point blank to recognise any kind of minority in its own country .
This is contrary to the Copenhagen criteria , which is embarrassing to the European Union and to the alliance .
I wish Macedonia every strength as it takes the next few steps in spite of Greece .
( DE ) Mr President , not only is Croatia culturally and historically anchored in Central Europe , but also it already meets all the accession criteria .
Therefore , we should not be putting any unnecessary obstacles in its way .
With the settlement of the fisheries dispute , Croatia has once more affirmed its readiness for EU membership , and the Croatian Government is also strengthening its efforts to combat corruption .
Nevertheless , Croatia 's rapid admission , which has now come within its grasp , should not in my view lead to automatic entry for any other states .
As is generally known , Macedonia is having to battle with not only corruption , but also economic problems and the rule of law .
Particularly with regard to Kosovo 's declaration of independence , it remains to be seen whether the ethnic peace with the Albanian minority can continue in the long term .
We must not repeat the mistakes of past enlargement rounds .
The EU must in my view finally wake up to the fact that unresolved conflicts , cultural differences and socioeconomic problems do not vanish into thin air with accession .
( HU ) Thank you , Mr President .
As chairman of the Croatia-EU Joint Parliamentary Committee , I feel that recent months have brought a favourable turn of events in Croatia 's Euro-Atlantic integration process .
A few weeks ago , Mr Barroso outlined the road map for concluding accession negotiations by autumn 2009 , and last week Croatia received an invitation to join NATO .
Both of these developments are an acknowledgement that Croatia is on the right track , and the international community is rewarding the efforts of the Croatian government .
It is no coincidence that the Eurobarometer result in Croatia has risen above 60 % again for the first time in a long time .
I also think it was a remarkable and wise attitude that led to our Croatian friends ' decision not to enforce the fishing protection zone in the case of European Union Member States in the interests of Croatia 's membership of the European Union .
On the issue of Kosovo 's independence , the government of Mr Sanader has likewise pursued a moderate course by aligning itself with the majority of EU Member States and recognising Kosovo 's independence .
Mr President , the fact that the Croatian Serb minority has been given the post of deputy prime minister in the current cabinet has contributed greatly - as others have already said - to stability in the region and peace among the different ethnic groups .
I believe it is unfair on the part of the Slovenian Prime Minister to announce that he would not rule out vetoing Croatia 's accession to the EU because of the border issue between the two countries .
EU enlargement and the fate of a nation must not be tied to resolving a bilateral dispute over borders .
The report carries a positive message in that it recognises the progress made by Croatia as regards stability in the Western Balkan region , as regards ensuring the country 's economy is ready to compete in the European Union context , and as regards institutional reforms and adoption of European Union legislation .
Alongside the positive points , however , the report does not shrink from mentioning the challenges that face us : reforming the judicial system , combating organised crime and corruption , bringing refugee returns to a conclusion , and resolving or alleviating bilateral tensions .
I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Swoboda .
Mr President , first of all I would like to congratulate Hannes Swoboda and Erik Meijer on their 2007 progress reports on Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia respectively .
Both reports are excellent .
As a Socialist Group shadow for the report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , I would like to thank Mr Meijer for his serious and honest cooperation during the making of this report .
